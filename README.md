# UWaterlooCrashout

Welcome to UWaterlooCrashout, the world's most overengineered solution to a problem that could theoretically be solved with a pen and paper if you possessed either the patience of a medieval monk or the organizational skills that your high school guidance counselor optimistically assumed you would develop by age twenty. 

This application leverages the full power of modern computing to automate the ancient art of "staring at a course calendar until your eyes bleed," transforming what was once a rite of passage involving printed course schedules, highlighters, and the kind of existential dread typically reserved for tax season into a streamlined digital experience that will consume roughly the same amount of your mental energy but with significantly more Python dependencies. Built for University of Waterloo students who have reached the philosophical conclusion that writing code to solve their scheduling problems is somehow more rational than simply accepting that Tuesday 8:30 AM lectures are a form of character building, this tool queries the UWaterloo OpenData API with the determination of a CS major who just discovered that correlation does not imply causation and wants everyone to know about it. 

The application performs an exhaustive search through all possible combinations of lecture and tutorial sections with the computational intensity typically reserved for cryptocurrency mining or training neural networks to recognize cats, except instead of generating digital currency or feline classification models, it generates the profound realization that your ideal schedule was always going to require you to take that one course with the professor whose Rate My Professor reviews read like a collection of Yelp reviews for a restaurant that exclusively serves disappointment. 

In the grand tradition of engineering students who approach every life problem as if it were a design optimization challenge, UWaterlooCrashout treats course selection with the same methodical rigor that others might apply to space mission planning, because apparently the natural human response to "I need to pick some classes" is "let me write a conflict detection algorithm." Whether you use this tool to finally achieve scheduling nirvana or simply to confirm that the universe has a personal vendetta against your Tuesday morning availability, UWaterlooCrashout stands as a monument to the beautiful absurdity of solving simple problems in the most complicated way possible, proving once and for all that the real education was the unnecessarily complex Python scripts we wrote along the way.
